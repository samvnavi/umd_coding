Q. What should the program do if the user denies the confirmation of his move 
	three times?
A. The project description states "The user has up to three attempts before 
	confirming a move". So after the user enters 'n' twice, the third 
	attempt is his last chance and any valid move will be considered 
	confirmed. The program should not prompt the user to confirm for 
	the third time.
